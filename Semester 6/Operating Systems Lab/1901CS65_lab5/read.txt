I recollect that my first exploit in squirrel shooting
was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley.
I had wandered into it at noontime,
when all nature is peculiarly quiet,
and was startled by the roar of my own gun,
as it broke the Sabbath stillness around
and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.
The leather jacked showed the scars of being his favorite for years.
It wore those scars with pride, feeling that they enhanced his presence
rather than diminishing it.
The scars gave it character and had not overwhelmed to the point
that it had become ratty.
The jacket was in its prime and it knew it.
Do Not Enter.The sign made it clear that they didn't want anyone around.
That wasn't going to stop Jack. Jack always lived with the notion
that signs were mere suggestions,
not actually absolute rules.
That's why the moment Jack looked at the "Do Not Enter" sign,
he walked past it and onto their property.
